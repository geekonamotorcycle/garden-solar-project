## Requirements and notes

The battery will be zip tied to the bottom of the box in such a way that it will be in contact with the botthom of the
back to leave room for other components

The BT-1 is double sided taped to the lif of the enclosure and the Excess wiring is bunled and attached to the lid.

The MPPT is on its side and is zip tied to the uper region of the box

I still need to know what DIN accessories are necessary for

1. the solar panels into the MPPT
2. The MPPT to the Battery
3. The 12vdc output to a theoretical camera
4. The 12VDC to 2 Strings of lights via a commercial off the shelf WLED controller.

We are creating a minimum viable safe Prototype at this time.
